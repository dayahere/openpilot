   ```

3. **Make your changes**
   - Follow the coding standards
   - Write tests for new features
   - Update documentation

4. **Run quality checks**
   ```bash
   python scripts/auto-fix.py
   npm run test:all
   ```

5. **Commit your changes**

   git commit -m "feat: add amazing feature"
   ```
   
   Follow conventional commits:
   - `feat:` new feature
   - `fix:` bug fix
   - `docs:` documentation changes
   - `style:` formatting changes
   - `refactor:` code refactoring
   - `test:` adding tests
   - `chore:` maintenance tasks

6. **Push to your fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

7. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Link any related issues
   - Describe your changes
   - Add screenshots for UI changes

## Development Setup

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for detailed setup instructions.

Quick start:
```bash
npm install
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm run build:all
```

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript/JavaScript

- Use TypeScript for new code
- Follow the existing code style
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Run `npm run lint` before committing

### Python

- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints
- Add docstrings for functions/classes
- Run `black`, `isort`, and `flake8` before committing

### Testing

- Write unit tests for new features
- Maintain 80%+ code coverage
- Test edge cases
- Use descriptive test names

Example:
```typescript
describe('AIEngine', () => {
  it('should return valid response for chat query', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```
