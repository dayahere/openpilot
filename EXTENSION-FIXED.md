# OpenPilot Extension - FIXED! ✅

## What Was Wrong
- `package.json` was pointing to `./dist/extension.js` (doesn't exist)
- Should have been pointing to `./out/extension.js` (TypeScript compiled output)

## What Was Fixed
1. Changed `package.json` main entry from `"./dist/extension.js"` to `"./out/extension.js"`
2. Restored `vscode:prepublish` script to compile TypeScript
3. Compiled the TypeScript source to create `out/extension.js`

## ✅ How to Use the Extension

### Quick Start (Every Time)
Run this command to launch the extension:
```powershell
code --extensionDevelopmentPath="i:\openpilot\vscode-extension"
```

OR:
1. Open folder: `i:\openpilot\vscode-extension` in VSCode
2. Press `F5`

### A new window opens: "[Extension Development Host]"
In THAT window, the extension commands work:
- `Ctrl+Shift+P` → `OpenPilot: Open Chat` ✅
- `Ctrl+Shift+P` → `OpenPilot: Explain Code` ✅
- `Ctrl+Shift+P` → `OpenPilot: Generate Code` ✅
- All other OpenPilot commands ✅

## Available Commands
1. **OpenPilot: Open Chat** - Start AI chat interface
2. **OpenPilot: Explain Code** - Get code explanations
3. **OpenPilot: Generate Code** - Generate new code
4. **OpenPilot: Refactor Code** - Improve code quality
5. **OpenPilot: Fix Code** - Auto-fix bugs
6. **OpenPilot: Analyze Repository** - Full repo analysis
7. **OpenPilot: Configure** - Setup AI provider (do this first!)
8. **OpenPilot: Create Checkpoint** - Save code state
9. **OpenPilot: Restore Checkpoint** - Restore previous state

## First-Time Setup
1. Launch extension (command above)
2. In Extension Development Host window:
   - `Ctrl+Shift+P` → `OpenPilot: Configure`
   - Choose AI provider:
     - **Ollama** (local, free, recommended)
     - **OpenAI** (needs API key)
     - **Grok** (needs API key)
     - **Together AI** (needs API key)
     - **HuggingFace** (needs API key)

## Why Development Mode?
- Extension runs from source code
- All dependencies available (`@openpilot/core`, etc.)
- No VSIX packaging issues
- Standard development practice

## Troubleshooting
If commands don't appear:
1. Make sure you're in the **[Extension Development Host]** window (not the original)
2. Check Debug Console: `View > Debug Console`
3. Check Output: `View > Output` → Select "Extension Host"
4. Reload window: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → `Developer: Reload Window`

## Future: Creating Installable VSIX
The VSIX packaging has dependency bundling issues. To fix:
1. Need to properly bundle `@openpilot/core` with webpack
2. Or publish `@openpilot/core` to npm registry
3. Development mode is the practical solution for now

**Status: WORKING ✅**
